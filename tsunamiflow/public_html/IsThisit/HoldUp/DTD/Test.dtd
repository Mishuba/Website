<!-- 
    An entity has three parts: it starts with an ampersand (&), then comes the entity name, and it ends with a semicolon (;).
-->

<!--  Make sure you look into XML Schemas as well.
    When to use a DTD
        With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree to use a standard DTD for interchanging data.
        With a DTD, you can verify that the data you receive from the outside world is valid.
        You can also use a DTD to verify your own data.
    
    When NOT to use a DTD
        XML does not require a DTD
        When you are experimenting with XML, or when you are working with small XML files, creating DTDs may be a waste of time.
        If you develop applications, wait until the specification is stable before you add a DTD. Otherwise, your software might stop working because of validation errors.
