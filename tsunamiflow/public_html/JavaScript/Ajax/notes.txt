What is Ajax

Ajax = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

AJAX is not a programming language

AJAX just uses a combination of:
    A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

AJAX is a mislanding name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. 

HOw It Works
    An event occurs in a web page the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
    An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
    The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
    The server processes the request
    The server sends a response back to the web page
    The response is read by JavaScript
    Proper action like page update is performed by JavaScript
